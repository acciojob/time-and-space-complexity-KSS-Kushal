	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as how much time is require to run the code and complete the task. As a programmer we need to reduce the time complexity of a program by optimizing the code and make it more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of space used by program. For example: if there is an array of input size n then the space complexity of this program will be O(n).</p>
